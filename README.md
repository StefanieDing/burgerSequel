# burgerSequel

Created during Week 15 of Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. Node, Express, Handlebars, and MySQL burger app that allows user to select a burger or side and then 'devour' it. Remake of my original Burger app found [here](https://github.com/StefanieDing/burger). This uses the Sequelize ORM rather than raw MySQL queries.
